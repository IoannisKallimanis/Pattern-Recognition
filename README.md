This is the Project of the Pattern Recognition subject in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki  

  For the 1st three parts we had to check the some classifications algorithms in the dataset.csv file  
  We use the **Bayes Algorithm**, **KNN** algorthm and **SVM** with different kernel functions  
  The last part was to create an architecture to classify the data in datasetC.csv and get the labels23.npy of our model in the datasetCTest.csv
